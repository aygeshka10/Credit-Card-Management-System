# Credit-Card-Management-System
Created a system that allows the user to get information about customers and transactions using a program written in Java. The data is extracted from RDBMS, transformed using MapReduce and loaded into HDFS using Sqoop jobs. Finally, Hive is used to partition and properly store the data in the HDFS warehouse. These whole workflow is automated and optimized using Oozie coordinator.
